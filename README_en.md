This document contains code writing rules (Code Conventions) in the company Roistat. We have got a lot of experience in developing complex projects, with which we decided to share with others. You can take this document as is or use it as the basis for your own Code Conv.

Work on English translation is in progress. You can help us a lot if you make pull request.
